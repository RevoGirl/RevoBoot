RevoBoot v1.5.00
================
- RevoBoot project forked (PikerAlpha, October 2012).
- 
- Time to say goodbye to some of the legacy code.  Something I will do with the help of Sam's notes, 
- but not everything is written in stone.  Unfortenately.  Meaning that I will have to experiment and 
- improvise.  Hopefully achieving the same goals that she had in mind for you.
-
- Support for self compiled libcc_kext.a (Xcode 4.5.1 compatibility) added (PikerAlpha, October 2012).
- SMBIOS legacy code removed (PikerAlpha, October 2012).
- EFI/SMBIOS data logic moved to preprocessor code (PikerAlpha, October 2012).
- RevoBoot/i386/config/settings.h stripped for simplicity (PikerAlpha, October 2012).
- 
- Note: If there is anything that doesn't work for you... let me know and I will look at it.
-
- Xcode 4.5.1 compatibility: Copy an older version of libcc_kext.a to RevoBoot/i386/util/
